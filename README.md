<p align="center"><b>Configurable, vanilla-friendly magical Staffs to enhance 1.12.2 survival. 

</b>

-----------------

Are you tired of over-produced and under-polished magical elements in popular 1.12.2 mods? Do you wish magical abilities didn't involve 10 GUI elements and countless crafting recipes?

Mystical Staffs adds 10 vanilla-friendly Staffs, useful for modpack devs. These staffs have no crafting recipes but can be added through CraftTweaker or similar mods.

Each staff has well-created, appropriate sound effects and particle effects to go along with it!

**Nearly all features of these staffs can be customized.** Make sure to check out the config file, or use the in-game Forge configs for on-the-fly adjustments of your staffs!

<h1 ><p align="center">Meet the Staffs:

<h2>Fire Staff</h2>

Ignites all non-player hostiles (configurable) in a set radius. Useful for packs of mobs, or to get cooked meats!


<h2>Glow Staff</h2>

Reveals all mobs in a set radius.


<h2>Wind Staff</h2>

Launches the player horizontally with an explosive gust of wind.

<h2>Flight Staff</h2>

Launches the player vertically with an explosive gust of wind. While this staff is held in either hand, fall damage is prevented.

<h2>Heal Staff</h2>

Grants a configureable amount of Instant Health to all nearby mobs (healing most, damaging the undead). Can also grant the user a separately configurable amount of Instant Health, to encourage PvE play (by healing other players more than yourself). Use [Potion Tweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/potion-tweaker) to change the amount that the Instant Health effect provides!

<h2>Invisibility Staff</h2>

Grants a configureable amount of Invisibility to the user. Use [Potion Tweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-invisibility/files?version=1.12.2) to make Invisibility work the way it's supposed to!

<h2>Path Staff</h2>

Upon use, summons a temporary floating path of ice blocks out of thin air. Look upwards or downwards to summon the path at an angle for climbing/descending heights. Many useful configs for this one!


<h2>Iceball Staff</h2>

Hurls a large Iceball (seen from the Mowzie's Mobs Frostmaw) that causes slight damage, freezing all mobs in its path. Mobs on fire will melt through the ice quite quickly.

The mowziemobs.cfg config file has a `S:freeze_blacklist` to add entities you don't wish to freeze!

<h2>Solar Beam Staff</h2>

Upon use, fires a massive beam of solar energy from the player (seen from the Mowzie's Mobs Barako) that penetrates through multiple mobs, and cooks mob drops. REALLY fun, highly recommend giving this one a try!

The mowziemobs.cfg config file has a `D:suns_blessing_attack_multiplier` to change the damage dealt from this attack.

<h2>Sunstrike Staff</h2>

Right click the ground from a range to summon a storm of Sunstrikes (delay, amount, and radius configurable) that pound the ground from the sky above, damaging and igniting all mobs within the radius!

While this staff is really strong, especially at range, it can only be successfully used if the target block area is exposed to the sky.

# Integrations (not required, but highly recommended!):

**[Mowzie's Mobs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mowzies-mobs/files?version=1.12.2)** for the Sunstrike Staff, the Solar Beam Staff, the Iceball Staff, and the Path Staff.

**[Elenai Dodge 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/elenai-dodge-2/files?version=1.12.2)**, where the Dodge Feather Bar can be utilized as a "Magic/Stamina" mechanic!
